Array to List and List to Array Conversion
This Java program demonstrates how to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.

Open the directory in an IDE or editor of your choice that supports Java.
Compile and run the ArrayToList2.java file.
Program Description
This Java program has a class named ArrayToList2, which has two methods named array_list and array_list_2. The array_list method converts an integer array into an ArrayList using a for loop and the add method of the ArrayList class. The array_list_2 method converts an ArrayList of integers back into an array using the size and get methods of the ArrayList class.

The program outputs the converted ArrayList and array to the console.

Note that the program is not interactive and uses hardcoded values for the array and ArrayList. However, you can modify the program to accept user input or read the values from a file or database.
